Data Product Studio
A Multi-Agent System for Designing Banking Data Products

Data Product Studio is an innovative platform designed to streamline the creation of data products for the banking industry. Built on a multi-agent architecture, it integrates specialized agents to handle every aspect of data product design—from interpreting banking use cases to ensuring compliance with industry standards. With a clean, Google-inspired Streamlit UI, this tool empowers users to interactively design, analyze, and certify data products, making it ideal for financial analysts, data engineers, and banking professionals.

Features
Multi-Agent Architecture: A modular system with specialized agents for comprehensive data product development.
Business Analyst Agent: Analyzes banking use cases, extracting entities, metrics, and goals (e.g., "customer churn," "revenue trends").
Data Designer Agent: Recommends optimal schemas and storage patterns tailored to banking needs (e.g., transactional or analytical data).
Source and Mapping Agents: Identifies and connects banking data sources (e.g., CRM, transaction logs) to the designed schema.
Certification Agent: Ensures compliance with banking standards, certifying data quality and governance.
Streamlit-Based UI: A minimalistic, interactive interface for use case input, analytics visualization, and design review.
Tech Stack
Python 3.9+: Core programming language.
Streamlit: Frontend framework for interactive UI.
Plotly: Visualization library for analytics dashboards.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Clustering and scaling for analytics.
NetworkX: Network visualization in analytics.
Sentence Transformers: NLP for use case analysis (optional).
Statsmodels: Time-series forecasting in analytics.
ReportLab: PDF report generation.
AsyncIO: Asynchronous processing for agent tasks.

Access the UI:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.
Log in with default credentials: admin@example.com / admin123.
Explore Features:
Home: View key metrics (e.g., users, revenue).
Use Case: Input a banking use case (e.g., "Track customer churn daily") and click "Analyze."
Analytics: Upload a CSV or use sample data to explore demographics, trends, and forecasts.
Design: Review the auto-generated schema and storage recommendations.
Mappings: Check data source connections.
Certification: Validate compliance with banking standards.
Export: Download results as JSON or PDF from the sidebar.
Sample Banking Use Case
"Create a daily dashboard to monitor customer transactions and revenue trends for a retail banking segment."

Entities: customer, transactions, revenue
Metrics: revenue, transaction count
Frequency: daily
Goal: Monitor trends

Customization
Add Banking Data: Replace the sample data in the "Analytics" section with real banking datasets (CSV format).
Extend Agents: Modify agent classes (e.g., BusinessAnalystAgent) to include additional banking-specific logic.
UI Tweaks: Adjust the CSS in run_streamlit_app() for branding or additional minimalism.
Troubleshooting
ModuleNotFoundError: Ensure all dependencies are installed (pip install <missing-package>).
Port Conflict: If 8501 is in use, Streamlit will prompt an alternative port.
NLP Errors: If Sentence Transformers fail, the app will run with reduced NLP capabilities (see logs).
